<H1>JAPE: A Jagged Alliance 2 Person Editor</H1>
<H1>Version 0.40</H1>

<H2>About JAPE</H2>

<P>JAPE is a save game editor for Jagged Alliance 2. JAPE allows you to
view and edit the items and attributes of your mercenaries, or any
other character in the game.</P>

<P>JAPE works with the following versions of Jagged Alliance 2:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>US version 1.03  (build 99.06.09)</LI>
    <LI>US version 1.04  (build 99.08.11)</LI>
    <LI>US version 1.05r (build 99.09.15)</LI>
    <LI>US version 1.06  (Build 99.11.12)</LI>
    <LI>US version 1.07  (Build 00.05.29)</LI>
  </UL>
<P>Other versions may work, but are untested.</P>

<P>JAPE does not work with version 1.13.</P>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>

<P>JAPE requires that you install the Sun Java runtime, version 5 or
above.  If you don't have this installed already, go to the
<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/">Java Download Page</a>
and get it.
</P>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<P>Download the file <A href="JAPE040.zip"><TT>JAPE040.zip</TT></A>.</P>

<P>Extract the contents of <TT>JAPE040.ZIP</TT> into the directory where you
installed Jagged Alliance 2. Sorry, no InstallShield setup program.</P>

<H2>Running JAPE</H2>

<H3>Starting Jape</H3>

<P>From the desktop, create a shortcut to the file <TT>JAPE.JAR</TT>,
and double-click on the shortcut. The JAPE main window should
appear. Or from the command line, go to the Jagged Alliance directory
and type <TT>JAPE.JAR</TT></P>

<P>If you doubleclick <TT>JAPE.JAR</TT> and you get an error message
saying that "<TT>Windows cannot open this file:</TT>",
then you need to install the Sun Java runtime.  See above.</P>

<H3>Opening a Saved Game</H3>

<P>From the <I>File</I> menu, select <I>Open...</I>. 
Navigate to the <TT>SavedGames</TT> directory and select a saved game file. 
The saved games will be named
<TT>SaveGame01.sav</TT>, <TT>SaveGame02.sav</TT>, etc.</P>

<H3>Editing Character Data</H3>

<P>The left side of the JAPE window contains a list of all the editable
characters in the saved game. Characters with a * beside their name
are the mercenaries on your team. Click on the name of character, and
his/her statistics will be displayed on the right side of the window.</P>

<P>The middle of the JAPE window contains detailed information on a
single character. Some information is only present for your currently
hired mercenaries. Most of the fields are editable. Go ahead, give
your custom merc 99 Marksmanship.</P>

<P>The right side of the JAPE window contains information on the
currently selected merc's equiptment. Again, this information is only
present for your currently hired team members.</P>

<H3>Save Your Changes</H3>

Once you're happy with the changes you've made, open the <I>File</I> menu
and select <I>Save</I>.
